If $x_N$ (size $N$) is $S-sparse$ then an under-determined system $A_{kN}x_{N}
=b_k$ -- where $b$ is vector of $k$ observations -- can be solved _exactly_
given that $A$ (__mesurement matrix__) has following properties:

- $\left\Vert y\right\Vert^2 \sim = \left\Vert x \right\Vert ^2$ where $y = A x$
  for any sparse signal $x$ i.e application of measurements matrix does not
  change the length of sparse signal $x$ 'very much'. See Restricted Isometric
  Property in @sec:rip .

# A demonstration using Python

Lets there is a sparse signal $x$ of length $N$. Its sparse. We take a
dot-product of x with a random vector $A_i$ of size N i.e. $b_i = A_i * x$. We
make $k$ such measurements. We can put all k $A_i$ into a matrix $A$ and
represent the process by a linear system:

$$\begin{bmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_k \end{bmatrix} * x = 
\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_k \end{bmatrix} $$ {#eq:underdetermined_system}

Note that each $A_i$ has the dimension $1 \times N$. We can rewrite
@eq:underdetermined_system as following:

$$A x = b$$ {#eq:underdetermined_system_compact} where dimension of $A$ are $k
\times N$ and $k << N$. This is an under-determined system with the condition
that $x$ is sparse. Can we recover $x$ (of size N) from b (of size k $<<N$)? 

Figure @fig:system shows a real system. Compressed sensing says that $x$ can be
recovered by solving the following linear program.

$$\min_x \left\Vert x \right\Vert_1 \; \text{given} \; Ax = b$$

![__x__ is the sparse signal of length 256. Using measurements matrix __A__, we
made 64 random measurements of $x$ namely __b__. The sparse solution of
@eq:underdetermined_system_compact is the solution of $\min_x \left\Vert x
\right\Vert_1 \text{given}\; Ax =b$. ](./figure_compressend_sensing.pdf){#fig:system}

# Mathematical definitions

## Restricted isometric property (RIP) {#sec:rip }

Restricted isometric property (RIP) of a matrix $A$ is defined as the
following.

Given $\delta_s \in (0,1)$, for any sub-matrix $A_s$ of $A$, and for any sparse
vector $y$, if following holds

$$ (1-\delta_s) \left\Vert y \right\Vert^2 \leq \left\Vert A_s y \right\Vert ^2
\leq (1+\delta_s) \left\Vert y \right\Vert ^2 $$

then matrix $A$ is said to satify $s-$restricted isometric property with
restricted isometric constant $\delta_s$. _Note that a matrix A with such a
property does not change the length of singal $x$ 'very much'_. This enables us
to sense two different sparse signal $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $A x_1$ and $A
x_2$ are almost likely to be different.
