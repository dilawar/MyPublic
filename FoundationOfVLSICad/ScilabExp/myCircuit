# This is my circuit.
# This is net-list of my circuit. It should be read as spice net-list unless
# otherwise stated explicitly e.g. IXX means current source, VXX is voltage
# source, RXX is resistance and so on.
#
# Only difference here is that we do not allow lower-case letters for circuit
# element names.
# n0 is always the ground node.
