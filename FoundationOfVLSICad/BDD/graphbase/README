TO INSTALL THESE PROGRAMS

First install CWEB (version 2.4 or greater), which can be found in
various archives; the master files reside at labrea.stanford.edu.
Then, on a UNIX-like system, edit the Makefile as instructed there,
and "make install".

Complete instructions will appear in a book by D. E. Knuth entitled
  The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Algorithms.

Note: The system is presently in alpha-test state, meaning that everything
appears to work on at least one system; but experience on a broad range
of computers is lacking. Please communicate all suggested improvements to
winkler@sunburn.stanford.edu, with subject line "GraphBase Alpha Test".
