Implementation of Reduced Order binary decision diagrams using Knuth Graphbase.
In example directory, we have created some examples. We have used noweb literate
programming tool for our programs. Knuth has used cweb. 

May be we'll also learn cweb.

In Example directory, we have created one stand-alone program which is
to be given to class. It is simple program to construct a BDD using C.
I am confused should I write it as literate code.
