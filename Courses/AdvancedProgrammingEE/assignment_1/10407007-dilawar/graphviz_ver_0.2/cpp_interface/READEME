===================
WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?

This Makefile project is made as a solution to assignment 01 given in 'Advanced
Computing for Electrical Engineers' course taken at Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay by this human in Autumn 2010. 

It does two things.

1. It generates text file which can be consumed by the 'dot tool' to generate graphs
	 corresponding to the 'quick find' algorithm.( "Quick Find algorithm is not
	 implemented in this version.  
  
Both of these algorithms are discussed in the class as well as in the book.

===================
HOW TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM

Extract the files and go to cpp-interface directory.
		make all
This should build the application.
		
Run Following
		gv-interface -f <file name>

<file-name> should be written in two column format without any non-zero or
non-negative entries. However, the application search for the integars only

This program is incomplete. But it will produce <file name>.dot file in this
directory. U can run dot tool on it.
