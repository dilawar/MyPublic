                          -------------

1. Define  a function  isPrime which accepts  a number n,  and returns
True if n is prime and False otherwise.

2.   A perfect  number is  one whose  factors add  up to  itself.  For
example 6 and 28 are the  first two perfect numbers.  Write a function
isPerfect that returns True if the  input number n is a perfect number
and False otherwise.

3. Write a  function powerFactor which takes two arguments  a and b
and returns the largest n such that

      a = b ^ n * k if a ≥ b
      b = a ^ n * k otherwise

4.  Simpson’s rule  is an  accurate method  of  numerical integration.
Using Simpson’s rule, the integral of  a function f between a and b is
approximated as

  h/3* [y_0 + 4*y_1  + 2*y_2 + 4*y_3  + 2*y_4 +... + 4*y_{n-1} + y_n]

   where h  = (b−a)/n,  for some  even integer n,  and y_k  = f(a+kh).
(Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.)

Define a procedure simpson that takes  as arguments f, a, b, and n and
returns the value of the  integral, computed using Simpson’s Rule. Use
your procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n =
1000).


5. Represent  a fraction as  (Float, Float), and define  the following
functions:

 (a) makeFraction  a b which returns  (x,y) such that x/y  is a proper
fraction equivalent to a / b. For eg, make fraction 10 4 should return
(5,2).

 (b) numer f and denom f which return the numerator and denominator of
f.

 (c) sum f1 f2 which returns f1+f2.

 (d) equal f1 f2 which returns True if  f1==f2 and False otherwise.


6. Define a function numReverse  n which returns a number whose digits
are the  in the  reverse order  of the digits  in n.   numReverse 1234
should return 4321, numReverse 120 should return 21.

7.   Write a  function hasSolution  a b  c which  returns True  if the
diophantine equation ax + by = c has solutions for integer values of x
and y. Hint : What condition should  c satisfy with respect to a and b
for a solution to exist?

8. The zero of  a function f(x) is a value x_0 such  that x_0 = f (x_0
). If x_n is the current approximation of the zero of a function, then
a better  approximation x_{n+1} is  given by:

               x_{n+1}  = x_n −  f (x_n)/f' (x_n )

Use this  fact to define  a function approxSqrt  n eps that  finds the
square root of  a number n. It stops when  one approximation is within
eps of the next.

9.  Write a function phi n representing Euler’s totient function.

In mathematical notation, phi(m) is  defined as the number of positive
integers r(1 <= r <= m) that are  coprime to m.  Example: m = 10 has r
= 1,3,7,9.  Thus phi(10) = 4.
