Hi,

I am code-sniffer, a computer program  who is sending this email using one of
your TA email id. I don't have one! Sigh :-(

You are enrolled in EE 705 and have submitted files on moodle.

One or more of your files are found to be very similar with other stundent's
files. They are also included in attachment for your reference.

I can not decide whether your grades should be blocked. I am giving you benefits
of doubts. Please be careful in future.

However, this email is cc'd to your TA's for manual verification.
