\paragraph{Problem 1}

Write a function $ps :: Integer \rightarrow Integer$ that calculates the number of the
ways in which an n-operand expression can be parenthesized.  For example, $ps 4$
evaluates to 5 because there are 5 ways of parenthesizing a 4-operand
expression, namely $a-(b-(c-d))$, $ a-((b-c)-d)$,
$(a-b)-(c-d)$,$(a-(b-c))-d$,$((a-b)-c)-d$. (extra credit for using list
comprehension).

\paragraph{Discussion}
An expression $a * b$ where $*$ is any binary operation can be considered as a
binary graph with values are its leaf. Such a binary graph represents
parenthesized expression. For three variables, for instance $a$ $b$, and $c$, we
can have two possible parenthesized expressions: $(a+b)+c, a+(b+c)$.

immaterial i.e. $(a+b)$ and $(b+a)$ are same expressions.}

One can reformulate above problem as \textit{Given $n$ variables, in how many
ways one can construct such binary-trees are showsn in figure
\ref{fig_bin_tree}.}

\begin{theorem}
For given $n > 2$ variables, one can construct $\sum_{x=1}^{n} f(x) \times
f(n-x)$ where $f(1) = f(2) = 1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We prove it by induction. For $n = 2$, there is

    Here each of the alphabets above  stand for a distinct digit such that
    the resulting addition is correct.  Write a Haskell expression using list
    comprehension  which will  solve  the puzzle  and  give the  following
    output: $[(s,9), (e,5), (n,6), (d,7), (m,1), (o,0),(r,8),(y,2)]$. 

\paragraph{Discussion}

By looking at the solution, we are assuming that this is radix-10 computation.
By the property of radix-10 computation, in any step carry could be either 0 or
1. Thus $m$ is fixed to be 1, and $s + 1 = 10*1 + o$. Depending on whether there
was a carry from the previous computation, one can formulate the possible set of
equations. Since the computation depends on 'if there was a carry', what could
be a better way than a binary-decision diagram to encode the whole computation.

As the caption of previous figure reads, we need to generate all such 16 systems
of linear equations and test them for unique solutions which condition that all
variables have values between 0 and 10.

One such a system is following.

\paragraph{Problem 3} 
    Using list comprehension, write a Haskell function queens $n$ which
    will generate all solutions of the $n$-queens problem.  You may find it useful
    to represent a solution using only column numbers. For example, a solution to
    the 8-queens problem may be $[1,5,8,6,3,7,2,4]$ which actually means
    $[(1,1),(2,5),(3,8)...]$.

listToTree [] = []
listToTree (x:xs) = (Node x []) : (listToTree xs)

-- Generate the chessboard.

allMoves n = [(x,y) | x <- [1..n], y <- [1..n]]
chessboard = allMoves 4

-- Generate all possible location left for other queens when one queen is placed

posMov :: (Int, Int)  -> [(Int, Int)]
posMov  (a, b) = [(x, y) | (x,y) <- chessboard
        , x + y /= a + b
        , x - y /= a - b
        , y /= b, x /= a

Q4. Let x & y be two integers such that 1 < x < y and x+y < 100. 'A' is given
    the sum (x+y) and 'B' is given their product (x*y).  The following conversation
    happens, A:I dont't know the numbers.  B:I knew that already.  A:Now I know the
    numbers.  B:Now I too know the numbers.  Write a Haskell program to find out the
    numbers. Make use of list comprehension.

Q5. Use the functions map and concat instead of the list comprehension notation
    to deﬁne the following list: [ (x,y+z) | x<-[1..10], y<-[1..x], z<-[1..y] ]


Q6. Implement foldTree for BTree analogous to fold for Lists. The function
    foldBTree has to provide replacement for each constructor. Implement flatten
    using foldTree.

Q7. Write a function isBST :: BTree -> Bool which takes a BTree and returns True
    if it is a Binary Search Tree otherwise returns false.  The function should
    traverse the tree only once.

Q8. We  have  seen  that  expressions  in  C-like  languages
    (uncurried  expressions) can  be represented  as  Gtree Char,
    where Gtree is defined as:

           data   Gtree  a = Gnode  a  [Gtree  a]

    Similarly,  expressions in  Haskell-like  languages in  which
    functions  are  applied  one  argument  at  a  time  (curried
    expressions) can be represented as Btree Char, where Btree is
    defined as:

        data  Btree  a = Leaf  a  |   Bnode  (Btree  a ) (Btree  a)

    Write a  function b_to_g  :: Btree Char  -> Gtree  Char which
    will   take  a  Btree   representation  of   a  Haskell-style
    expression and  convert it into  a Gtree representation  of a
    C-style  expression.  Similarly  write a  function  g_to_b ::
    Gtree Char  -> Btree Char which will  take C-style expression
    and convert it into a Haskell style expression.
