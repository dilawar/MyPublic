===================
WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?

This Makefile project is made as a solution to assignment 01 given in 'Advanced
Computing for Electrical Engineers' course taken at Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay by this human in Autumn 2010. 

It does two things.

1. It generates text file which can be consumed by the 'dot tool' to generate graphs
	 corresponding to the 'quick find' algorithm. 
2. It generates text file which can be consumed by the 'dot tool' to generate
	 graphs corresponding to the 'quick union' algorithm.
  
Both of these algorithms are discussed in the class as well as in the book.
