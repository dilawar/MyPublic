%description
microdc is a command-line based Direct Connect client that uses the GNU
Readline library for user interaction. It was developed from ground up and
does not depend on any other program. Despite the command-line user
interface, microdc was designed to be user friendly and simple to use.

microdc is currently in beta state - there may be many bugs not yet
discovered. It also lacks some features that other clients support, such as
file hashing, multiple hub connections, and hub list support.
